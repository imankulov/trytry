About try-try
============

"try-try" ([traıtraı]) is our audacious attempt to create a framework for writing
"try-whatever" webservices.

There is a lot of services, aiming to teach you some brand-new buzzy languages,
technologies, database engines, etc. We want to make one step further and teach
you how to teach others. Therefore, if you're geeky, have a beard and have
just invented a new programming language, this project is for you.

What we propose:

- A Django-based application providing the interface for potential users of your
  new exciting language/technology/whatever
- A framework and a comprehensive set of rules that you can easily apply to
  test your visitors.
- A bunch of ready to use testflows, which you can use to start, play with, and
  write your own application on a basis of this code.
- Unless we run out of time, a set of shiny badges and connection with social
  networks will be at the service of your happy visitors.
